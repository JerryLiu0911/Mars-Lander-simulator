# Mars Lander Coursework
This is part of the courseowrk for the Engineering Tripos at the University of Cambridge part IA and IB. We implemented physics simulation for orbital mechanics, aerodynamic drag and even throttle delays through investigating Euler and Verlet numerical integration methods. We then combine with control theory to create an autopilot system using a PID controller to land the lander while prioritizing fuel efficiency under a variety of scenarios.
