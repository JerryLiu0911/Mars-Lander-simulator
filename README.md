# Mars Lander Coursework
This is part of the courseowrk for the Engineering Tripos at the University of Cambridge part IA and IB. We implemented physics simulation for orbital mechanics, comparing Verlet and Euler integrartion methods, combined with control theory to create an autopilot system to land the lander while prioritizing fuel efficiency under a variety of scenarios.
